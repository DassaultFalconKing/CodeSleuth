# CodeSleuth Documentation

## Canonical product contracts

- [`CODESLEUTH-PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md`](CODESLEUTH-PRODUCT-CONTRACT.md) — host/runtime ownership boundary, integration model, extension seams, and core feature freeze.
- [`CODESLEUTH-BRANDING.md`](CODESLEUTH-BRANDING.md) — accepted terminal-native UI/interaction runbook, ASCII identity source, documentation graphics rule, and responsive acceptance.
- [`CODESLEUTH-COLORMAP.json`](CODESLEUTH-COLORMAP.json) — machine-readable semantic colormap.
- [`CONTEXT-GRAPH-DISCIPLINE.md`](CONTEXT-GRAPH-DISCIPLINE.md) — Git source -> review state -> bounded RepositoryContextProjection -> compact context/Mermaid authority chain.
- [`NOVACLAW-MCP.md`](NOVACLAW-MCP.md) — first external-host MCP integration and its read-only repository-evidence boundary.

## Roadmap and evaluated extensions

- [`MERMAID-GRAPHIFY-AUDIT.md`](MERMAID-GRAPHIFY-AUDIT.md) — audit of the current bounded Mermaid/context-graph implementation and gated evaluation of `Graphify-Labs/graphify` as an optional deterministic structural graph provider. This is a roadmap/incubation document, not approval of a production Graphify dependency.

## README language maintenance

The public README is maintained in three complete language versions:

- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — canonical English source;
- [`../README.ru.md`](../README.ru.md) — Russian translation;
- [`../README.uk.md`](../README.uk.md) — Ukrainian translation.

Every semantic change to `README.md` must update both translations in the same change. Each translated README records the Git blob identity of the English source in a `README-SOURCE-BLOB` comment, and `tests/test_docs_contract.py` fails when either translation is stale. The language selector at the top of every README must continue to link the other two versions.

## Documentation media policy

CodeSleuth documentation is text-first and terminal-native.

- The canonical ASCII brand lives in `pack/.opencode/bin/codesleuth_tui.py` as `CODESLEUTH_ART`; the root README may copy it verbatim.
- UI manuals use terminal/text snapshots captured from the real application and exact implemented labels.
- Maintained PNG/JPEG/WebP/SVG UI mockups/reference boards are not part of the documentation contract.
- Mermaid is the allowed diagram format when relationships are materially clearer as encoded text. Mermaid source is reviewable presentation, not a second source of repository truth.

## Completed implementation packets

- [`archive/CURSOR-PRODUCTION-HANDOFF.md`](archive/CURSOR-PRODUCTION-HANDOFF.md) — completed PR #2 production-hardening packet, retained for historical evidence only. It is not an active task or branch instruction.

## User and operations

- [`USER-GUIDE.md`](USER-GUIDE.md) — install, configure, validate, update, and operate CodeSleuth.
- [`SELF-UPDATE.md`](SELF-UPDATE.md) — floating update, post-update Verify, controlled CodeSleuth process restart, source-checkout reload, and pinned-update boundaries.
- [`_includes/build-controller-blurb.md`](_includes/build-controller-blurb.md) — canonical OpenCode `build` controller blurb. Public copy: [root README](../README.md#opencode-build-controller).

## Maintainers

- [`MAINTAINER-SUBREPO.md`](MAINTAINER-SUBREPO.md) — standalone/subrepo maintenance and integration guidance.

```

Core CodeSleuth is feature-frozen. Growth continues through profiles, Skills, Playbooks, small tools, host integrations, and extension-management UX without adding a second execution runtime.
